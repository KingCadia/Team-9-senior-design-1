task for Daz

Go into project 2 and add on to the code so the software can pick out shapes.

The software can already pick out color and centriod location.

when you have the shape color and centroid location store all three of these in a struct called gameobject.
ie: 
	gameobject.shape
	gameobject.color
	gameobject.location

Then store all picked out shapes in a array of structs.

The code to get a clean black and white image is in the class impross
you will have to add on new proporties to the class and add on new methods to get the shape and centroid location

notes: 
	the code to get the centroid locations is not in impross it is in the main file impross only takes the background image and
	foreground image and processes them into a clean black and white image where centroids can be found
	
	the system is very sensitive to lighting conditions so be careful of that do not light the shot with anything other than the lights 
	already turned on in the lab
	
	the impross class enhances each color so in the image subtraction2 the colors will go as follows:
	red = 255, 0, 0
	green = 0, 255, 0
	blue = 0, 0, 255
	yellow = 200, 200, 50

	the final black and white image is bw subtraction and subtraction2 are intermediate images and subtraction2 is the image that
	you will get final colors when you get the centroid locations

	Work in your branch do not work in main
